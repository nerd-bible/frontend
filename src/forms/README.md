# Zod + Solid JS Forms

This package generates a form from a Zod schema. It provides sensible defaults
for controls and layout, but you may use the provided Zod registry to customize
every part of your form.

Popover errors use [@floating-ui/dom](https://floating-ui.com/docs/tutorial),
which you may also customize.
